		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Paella (pai·ei·uh) is a classic Spanish rice dish made with rice, saffron,
			vegetables, chicken, and seafood cooked and served in one pan. Although
			paella originates from Valencia, it’s recognized as the national food of
			Spain and there are several different varieties. The most common types of
			paella are chicken paella, seafood paella, or mixed paella (a combination
			of seafood, meats, and vegetables).
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled and then loosely measured</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>1/2 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
			<li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
			<li>6 ounces mild dried chorizo sausage, sliced into thin half-moons</li>
			<li>
				3 cups short-grain rice, such as Spanish Bomba rice or Italian Arborio
			</li>
			<li>1 (14-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
			<li>1 cup frozen green peas</li>
			<li>
				1 pound large (21-24 per pound) shrimp, peeled and deveined, with tails
				left on
			</li>
			<li>1 pound mussels, rinsed and scrubbed</li>
			<li>1 pound littleneck clams, rinsed and scrubbed</li>
			<li>1/4 cup chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Heat a gas grill to medium-high heat (375°F), or light a charcoal grill
				and let burn until the charcoal is covered with gray ash.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a boil. Add the
				saffron and salt. Turn off the heat and let the saffron steep for at
				least 15 minutes. Taste and add more salt, if needed.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				n a 12- to 14-inch stainless steel skillet or cast iron pan, heat the
				oil over medium heat on top of the stove. Add the onion and red pepper,
				and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Stir in
				the garlic and chorizo.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				On a table next to the grill, set the skillet with the sofrito, the
				rice, tomatoes, infused stock, salt, peas, shrimp, mussels, and clams.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				Set the skillet with the sofrito on the grill. Add the rice, and cook,
				stirring often, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the rice is coated with oil
				and lightly toasted. Stir in the stock, tomatoes, and peas. Taste for
				seasoning and add more salt, if you like. Spread the rice evenly over
				the bottom of the pan. Close the grill cover and simmer the rice without
				stirring for 15 minutes, or until the rice absorbs most of the stock. If
				the mixture looks dry, pour about 1 cup of hot water over it, but do not
				stir.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				Nestle the mussels and clams into the rice with the hinge sides up so
				they release their juices into the rice. Arrange the shrimp around the
				shellfish. Cover the pan with foil, close the grill and cook for 6 to 10
				minutes longer (depending on the heat of your grill), or until the rice
				and shrimp are both cooked through and the mussels and clams are open.
				(Discard any shellfish that remain tightly shut once everything else is
				cooked.)
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				Slip a spatula under the rice and check to see if you have achieved the
				elusive golden brown socarrat. If not, set the pan over the heat,
				uncovered, for a few minutes to lightly caramelize the bottom. Sprinkle
				with parsley and bring the whole pan to the table for serving.
			</li>
		</ol>
